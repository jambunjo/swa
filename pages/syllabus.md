# Syllabus

# Course Description
* Assurance is a reasoned, audit-able argument created to support claimed beliefs about a particular entity when it is impossible to examine every possible circumstance related to that claim
* This course is an intersection of knowledge areas necessary to perform activities relevant for promoting assurance in claims developed for `Software Security Engineering`
* This course takes on a software development lifecycle perspective for the prevention of flaws. It is not just secure coding!

# Class Meeting Time and Location for Fall 2018
* Wednesdays 5:30 to 8:10 p.m. in PKI 260
  - Lecture session: 5:30 to 6:40 PM
  - Working session: 7:00 to 8:10 PM

## Other Reference Books

* Problem Frames: Analyzing and Structuring Software Development Problems, By Michael Jackson, Addison-Wesley

I will post Lecture slides, readings, and supplemental materials in Canvas. Much of the course content will be maintained on Github.

# Additional References

* [Secure Programming for Linux and Unix HOWTO](http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/index.html), David Wheeler  
* [Software Assurance in Education, Training and Certification, Pocketguide](https://robinagandhi.github.io/swa/resources/pocketguide.pdf), Ed. Robin Gandhi

# Attendance
Attendance is highly encouraged. While lectures can be caught up with, there is no replacement for working sessions in the classroom. If you cannot attend class, then you must follow up with any given instruction, class assignment deadlines, and lecture notes.

# Policy on Plagiarism
Any exam or assignment material submitted which looks identical in any fashion to another student's work or external sources will be considered plagiarism. I will adjust the grade to the minimum possible (Zero) for the assignment for all parties involved. Any further offenses will result in an “F” for the course, accompanied by academic dishonesty actions taken by the College Dean. Note carefully the University policy on [academic integrity](http://goo.gl/NVWUBy) and [code of conduct](https://www.unomaha.edu/student-life/student-conduct-and-community-standards/policies/code-of-conduct.php).  
Make yourself familiar with writing techniques such that you can cite external sources without plagiarizing. Here are a few links to writing resources: [1](http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/563/01/), [2](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/589/01/)

Many of your deliverables will be on Github in a public repository. As a result, you must be extra careful to avoid plagiarism through responsible and ethical practices.

# Exams
There will be a mid-term and a final exam. The exams will consist of essay-type questions which may require design and modeling activities. These in-class exams will allow full access to technology and are intended to help focus on the essential parts of the course material, reinforce learning, and provide timely feedback. The exam questions will typically have multiple parts, be sure you answer all the parts.

# In-class Exercises
In-class exercises will correspond to the stages of the software development lifecycle. The objective of assignments is to gain hands-on experience with various techniques and tools for software assurance and apply them to build secure software. Details about the assignments will follow as we go further into the semester. I will recommend specialized software programs/tools for these assignments.

# Semester Project
Read all about it [here](https://robinagandhi.github.io/swa/pages/project.html).

# Grading
20% Mid-term  
20% Final exam (Comprehensive)  
20% In-class quizzes, open discussion, and class participation  
40% Assignments, Semester Project and Presentation (Team-based)  

# Course Meeting Schedule
In this semester there are scheduled ~16 class periods on Wednesdays for 160 minutes each. Accounting for in-class exams, project presentations, inclement weather days, instructor travel to conferences and the like we will have something closer to 10-11 class periods for instruction.

Due to the current and advanced nature of this class, it is under constant revision! So you can expect some experimentation and shuffling of the course topics as we progress through the semester. Constructive feedback on the content is highly encouraged. Fork it on Github!

# Book Keeping
All email sent to me regarding the class must have the class descriptor and your name in the subject field, e.g. (CYBR/CSCI 8420 - TOPIC). We will be using Canvas and Github for the course.
